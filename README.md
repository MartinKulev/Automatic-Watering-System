# Automatic-Watering-System
This project, completed in June 2023, is an automatic watering system created with Arduino. It tracks the soil moisture percentage and determines how much water is required based on a formula. Additionally, it monitors the light levels using a photoresistor to ensure the plant is watered at a specific time. When the time comes, the DC motor is engaged, and its operation duration is based on the liters of water needed.
